## Load dataset

``` r
data("nyc_airbnb")
```

``` r
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(borough = neighbourhood_group)
```

# Letâ€™s count

``` r
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  janitor::tabyl(borough,room_type)
```

-   How many rentals are there? Of what type? In what places?

-   Is price correlated with review scores?

-   Which neighborhood is most popular?

-   Which neighborhood has the highest review?

-   Is availability related to peice?

-   Is room type related to neighborhood?

-   Is length of state related to neighborhood group?

## My question: IS minimum\_nights related to room\_type?

    nyc_airbnb %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = minimum_nights))+
      geom_histogram()
      ggplot(aes(x = minimum_nights,y = price,color = room_type))+
      geom_point(size = 5, alpha = .6)

Price and room type

``` r
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = stars, y = price))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(.~room_type)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 10037 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Price and neighbourhood?

``` r
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  filter(borough == "Manhattan") %>% 
  group_by(neighbourhood) %>% 
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price,na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(mean_price)
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 x 2

``` r
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  filter(borough == "Manhattan",
         price <= 1000) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood,price)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = neighbourhood, y = price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()+
  facet_grid(.~room_type)

Price vs location

``` r
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  filter(price < 500) %>% 
  sample_n(5000) %>% ##deal with large datasets
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long,color = price))+
           geom_point(alpha = .5)
```

## retry leaflet

``` r
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  
  leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addMarkers(~lat,~long)
```
